# Depression-Predicting-Model
Model that predicts as a target value, whether the given individual suffers from depression. For further insides on the data anlysis and preprocessing, check out Data_analysis_and_model_testing.ipynb notebook, but in Depression_model.ipynb you will see the final workflow, combined with model testing.


How to use it?
Lest you have google collab, simply download the Depression_model.ipynb file and run it, but otherwise
you will need to download the following packages (best to use it with anaconda and jupyter, you can also do this via for example pycharm's environment):
Python version: 3.11.12
Pandas version: 2.2.2
Matplotlib version: 3.10.0
Numpy version: 2.0.2
Sklearn version: 1.6.1
Seaborn version: 0.13.2
Optuna version: 4.3.0
Xgboost version: 2.1.4
Joblib version: 1.4.2
(The code works and was only tested on these specific versions of these libraries, but it is expected to have backward compatibility (relatively))
